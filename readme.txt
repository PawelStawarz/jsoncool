			> What is jsonCool? <
	\---------------------------------------------------/

The idea behind creating the jsonCool library, was to provide a portable, lightweight
and object oriented C++ JSON API. In fact, the suffix "cool" means "compact, object
oriented library". JsonCool consists of exactly one header file, which can be easily
included into any project, in any environment, and is designed in a way, to make the
code similar to the code you have been used to, while working with the standard library.

JsonCool is able to parse both JSON files and strings containing JSON code. The same
applies to creating JSON from your data.
